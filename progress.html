                <span>What I did: (explain what you or your group did to finish your project.)</span>
                <br><br>
                <span>For the beginning of our project, everyone had their own tasks that everyone answered, and if something did not work out, then we all dealt with this problem together. I studied with Alice frontend.</span>
            </section>
            <br><br>
            <section>
                <span>What I enjoyed: (write about what you liked most about the project and the teamwork)</span>
                <br><br>
                <span>Most of all, I liked the process of what we were doing and learning something new and gaining new knowledge and experience. My team was friendly and we easily found contact between each other so it was a pleasure to work with them.</span>

            </section>
            <br><br>
            <section>
                <span>What I found difficult: (write about any part of the project you found hard to do.)</span>
                <br><br>
                <span>The only difficult thing was that everyone's design tastes were different and it was difficult to decide on the design, but otherwise everything was fine.</span>
                
            </section>

            <br><br>

            <section>
            <span>What really worked: (write about any part that you thought worked well).</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Everything we did turned out at once, except what color the pages would be. We argued long and hard, but then we listened to each other and everything worked out right away.</span>
            <br><br>
            </section>

            <br><br>
            <section>
                <span>Next time: (write what you would do differently next time).</span>
                <br><br>
            <span>Maybe I would have done it differently, but right now I like the way our project looks.</span>
